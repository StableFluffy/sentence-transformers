# Reranker Optimization Analysis

## Problem: Exponential API Calls

With batch size 2048 and (anchor, positive) pairs:

### Original RerankerCachedGISTEmbedLoss
- **Embeddings**: 4,096 (only student model) ✅
- **Reranker calls**: ~12,000,000 ❌
  - anchor-positive: 2048 × 2048 = 4M
  - anchor-anchor: 2048 × 2048 = 4M  
  - positive-positive: 2048 × 2048 = 4M

This is computationally infeasible!

## Solution: OptimizedRerankerCachedGISTEmbedLoss

### Key Optimizations

1. **Pre-filtering with Embeddings**
   - Use cosine similarity to identify potential hard negatives
   - Filter out obvious negatives (similarity < threshold)
   - Result: 90-95% reduction in candidates

2. **Top-K Selection**
   - Only rerank top 10% most similar candidates
   - Minimum 10, maximum 100 candidates per query
   - Result: From 2048 → ~20-100 candidates

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Easy negatives: Use embedding scores directly
   - Hard negatives: Use reranker for accurate scoring
   - Threshold: When similarity > 0.5 × positive_similarity

### Impact on Batch Size 2048

**Before optimization:**
- 12M reranker calls per batch ❌

**After optimization:**
- ~200K-500K reranker calls (95-98% reduction) ✅
- Focuses compute on hard negatives where it matters

### Example Calculation

For each query (2048 total):
- Original: 2048 × 3 = 6,144 reranker calls
- Optimized: ~100 × 3 = 300 reranker calls (95% reduction)

Total for batch:
- Original: 2048 × 6,144 = 12,582,912
- Optimized: 2048 × 300 = 614,400

## Configuration Guidelines

### Conservative (More Accurate)
```python
similarity_threshold=0.2      # Consider more candidates
top_k_ratio=0.2              # Rerank top 20%
min_top_k=20                 # At least 20 candidates
max_candidates=200           # Up to 200 candidates
hybrid_threshold=0.4         # Lower threshold
```

### Balanced (Recommended)
```python
similarity_threshold=0.3      # Default
top_k_ratio=0.1              # Top 10%
min_top_k=10                 # At least 10
max_candidates=100           # Up to 100
hybrid_threshold=0.5         # 50% of positive
```

### Aggressive (Faster)
```python
similarity_threshold=0.4      # Higher threshold
top_k_ratio=0.05             # Only top 5%
min_top_k=5                  # At least 5
max_candidates=50            # Up to 50
hybrid_threshold=0.6         # Stricter
```

## When to Use Each Loss

### Use RerankerCachedGISTEmbedLoss when:
- Small batch sizes (< 256)
- Need maximum accuracy
- Have unlimited API capacity
- Dealing with very similar texts

### Use OptimizedRerankerCachedGISTEmbedLoss when:
- Large batch sizes (> 256)
- Need to balance accuracy and efficiency
- Have API rate limits
- Most negatives are clearly different

## Performance Tips

1. **Monitor API Usage**
   - Log number of reranker calls per batch
   - Adjust thresholds based on your API capacity

2. **Tune Thresholds**
   - Start with default values
   - Increase similarity_threshold if too many calls
   - Decrease top_k_ratio for faster training

3. **Batch Size Considerations**
   - Larger batches benefit more from optimization
   - With batch 64: ~50K calls → ~5K calls
   - With batch 2048: ~12M calls → ~500K calls

4. **Quality vs Speed Trade-off**
   - More reranking = better quality but slower
   - Find the sweet spot for your use case
   - Monitor validation metrics to ensure quality
